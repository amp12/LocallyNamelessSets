<p><a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Agda</a> (version
2.6.2.2) was used to develop the theory of locally nameless sets and to
check some of the proofs in the paper</p>

<cite>Andrew M. Pitts. 2023. Locally Nameless Sets. Proc. ACM
Program. Lang. 7, POPL, Article 17, pp 488-514, January 2023. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3571210">https://doi.org/10.1145/3571210</a>

<p>The code mainly targets proofs that involve equational reasoning
combined with the use of atoms and indices that are sufficiently fresh
(via cofinite quantification). Some of these proofs involve a lot of
nested case analysis on elements of sets with decidable equality
(atoms and indices); some of the equational axioms are
unfamiliar-looking and combinatorially complicated; and it is easy to
forget to check necessary freshness conditions are satisfied when
doing informal proofs. For all these reasons the use of an interactive
theorem prover to produce machine-checked proofs was essential to gain
assurance that the results in the paper are correct.</p>

<p>The Agda code is stand-alone: some standard definitions (that might
otherwise be called from Agda's Standard Library) are collected in the
file <tt><a href="Prelude.html">Prelude</a></tt>.  The last part of
the development requires function extensionality, which we postulate
in the file <tt><a href="FunExt.html">FunExt</a></tt>. The root 
is the file <tt><a href="Everything.html">Everything</a></tt>.</p>
