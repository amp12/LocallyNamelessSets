<p><a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Agda</a> (version
2.6.2.2) was used to develop the theory of locally nameless sets and to
check some of the proofs in the paper.  The code mainly targets proofs
that involve equational reasoning combined with the use
of atoms and indices that are sufficiently fresh (via cofinite
quantification). Some of these proofs involve a lot of nested case
analysis on elements of sets with decidable equality (atoms and
indices); some of the equational axioms are unfamiliar-looking and
combinatorially complicated; and it is easy to forget to check necessary
freshness conditions are satisfied when doing informal proofs. For all
these reasons the use of an interactive theorem prover to produce
machine-checked proofs was essential to gain assurance that the
results in the paper are correct.</p>

<p>The Agda code is stand-alone: some standard definitions (that might
otherwise be called from Agda's Standard Library) are collected in the
file <tt><a href="Prelude.html">Prelude.agda</a></tt>.  The last part
of the development requires function extensionality, which we
postulate (file <tt><a href="FunExt.html">FunExt.agda</a></tt>).</p>
